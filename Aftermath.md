## Aftermath

Use social graph and personalisation technologies to create and present a creative nonfiction work about a piece of history and its ramifications.

### What

An exploration in narrative of using technologies that are used in digital marketing and information description and retrieval.

The assumption is that the most advanced content placement techniques are used in advertising networks by the likes of Google, Outbrain and Facebook. These companies lever multiple sources of personal information to target ads to end users using multiple and deep data sources such as Experian and their own big data stores. It would be fair - and ironic - to say that the technical pinnacle of computing is the serving of ads.

Deep data is driven by Graph technologies. These store entites in loose and complex structures which can be added to and reconfigured on the fly. Unlike static data where the central descriptor is a 'keyed' node (a static property of a node) and where complexity rapidly introduces labyrynthine complexity graph data is structured by relations. Graph data sits behind the friend of a friend and other complex content recommendation algorhythms that drive a platform like Netflix. Graph data is expressed in decriptive and active language; (Mary) - [friend] -> (Ben). Mary is a friend to Ben. This allows for poetic assemblages of data; you could say just as usefully Mary - shades -> Ben. Or The Moon - lives in - The Ocean.

Paralell to this we have seen a surge in the use of complex narratives in long-form work that spans fiction and non-fiction. The three-act structure is a useful tool in the arsenal for these succesful works but it's only one tool of many. Mystery and tone (early Madmen) are just as likely to create a great work as driving narrative (24, Homeland). Madmen is the classic case in point here - the dramatic questions of the first couple of series around Donald's past are simply abandoned and no one seemed to mind as long as the tone was right and interetsing people came in - indeed Peggy becomes the 'hero'. 

We have also become used to non-fiction where the writer explicity sits inside the work and uses the act of writing to further articulate the work of non-fiction. Here we get the work of authors like XXX who, in HHH, writes about an assisinatin attepmt on Heinreich Himmler from a distinctly personal point of view. This makes a series of events significantly more interesting, and we get the rise of podcasts that put the role of the investigator on the outside, as if the team investigating the Watergate scandal were making the movie of their investigation at the time they did it, not many years later.

While it is easier to say that narrative has become more complex beause we want it to it is probably more accurate to say that narrative is more complex because long-form content is a better platform for loyalty and therefore advertising. Star Wars is a case in point here - the 'first' movie was expliticty written from the three-act form using Joesph Campbells 'call to action' archetypes. The Star Wars Narrative Universe has long-since moved into a multi-strand narrative that is probably too complex for anyone to actually comprehend in one lifetime without being a very deep fan. 

While the creation of fans/consumers is the explicit call of the current practice of online content marketing it has, of course, always been the case. Long-running soaps (and indeed sporting events like the Tour De France) are all about what I call suspended narrative arcs (dramatic action is held back for very long periods of time) and have mined this area of story and commerce for decades. Perhaps it is more accurate to say that the internet has given us a platform able to move these long-form narratives from exploiting one class sytem to another; as the middle class expands and takes their 'devices' with them the internet and on-demand becomes the default culutal consumption device. 

It would also be fair to say that we have moved on from the excitement of fragmented stories and open story systems that characterised early hyperfiction - these remain more interesting in their conception than their executions. 

Despite the once apparently liberating principle of the hyperlink people like  stories that are told to them, both narrative and investigative, and are even more willing to invest long periods of time in good ones. However people are also more open to what makes a good story. 

What has shifted is that people 'do' stories in two ways - assembled by others (Stranger Things) but we are also prepared to assemble our own chains of meaning and interest by following loosely related ('recommended') content in what might be called hyper personal stories. This secondary form of self-directed story making is more akin to analysis in the classic mode - writing outselves with stories we make from fragments. Once this was undertaken with dreams, now the deep pool of alternative content that is the internet is a great substitute. This is writing as self-definition under the sign of the mystery - we like to solve ourselves, looking in the past, sifting truth and memory to create a story that fits our belief in ourselves that we then project to the world. We could call this activity #memeself, or simply as Facebook.







Aftermath will use techniques from 



So where do notions like the experience economy

What I am prosing is to bring together data-driven and graph technologies

Insert the story into existing ad networks

The reader can create a one-off work 

There is no 'master work'. This goes beyond branching and tagging, and extends into the use of objects and relations. The philosophical background relates to OOO and the Neo-realists while the creative impetous comes from works like HHH which mixes the true story of the 

Such literay excursions are nothing new, the notion of fact and fiction and stories within stories is as old as the '1001 nights'. Fiction that configures around alternative non-narrative forms like '247' or explicitly 

Fiction that explicitly uses autobiography as an articulating device is rarer. Perhaps this is only because 'life writing' has a bad name, or perhaps it is that life-writing is already so obviously fiction that no one notices.
