## Aftermath

Use social graph and personalisation technologies to create and present a creative nonfiction work about a piece of history and its ramifications.

### What

An exploration in narrative of using technologies that are used in digital marketing and information description and retrieval.

The assumption is that the most advanced content placement techniques are used in advertising networks by the likes of Google, Outbrain and Facebook. These companies lever multiple sources of personal information to target ads to end users using multiple and deep data sources such as Experian and their own big data stores. It would be fair - and ironic - to say that the technical pinnacle of computing is the serving of ads.

Deep data is driven by Graph technologies. These store entites in loose and complex structures which can be added to and reconfigured on the fly. Unlike static data where the central descriptor is a 'keyed' node (a static property of a node) and where complexity rapidly introduces labyrynthine complexity graph data is structured by relations. Graph data sits behind the friend of a friend and other complex content recommendation algorhythms that drive a platform like Netflix. Graph data is expressed in decriptive and active language; (Mary) - [friend] -> (Ben). Mary is a friend to Ben. This allows for poetic assemblages of data; you could say just as usefully Mary - shades -> Ben. Or The Moon - lives in - The Ocean.

Paralell to this we have seen a surge in the use of complex narratives in long-form work that spans fiction and non-fiction. The three-act structure is a useful tool in the arsenal for these succesful works but it's only one tool of many. Mystery and tone (early Madmen) are just as likely to create a great work as driving narrative (24, Homeland). Madmen is the classic case in point here - the dramatic questions of the first couple of series around Donald's past are simply abandoned and no one seemed to mind as long as the tone was right and interetsing people came in - indeed Peggy becomes the 'hero'. 

We have also become used to non-fiction where the writer explicity sits inside the work and uses the act of writing to further articulate the work of non-fiction. Here we get the work of authors like XXX who, in HHH, writes about an assisinatin attepmt on Heinreich Himmler from a distinctly personal point of view. This makes a series of events significantly more interesting, and we get the rise of podcasts that put the role of the investigator on the outside, as if the team investigating the Watergate scandal were making the movie of their investigation at the time they did it, not many years later.

While it is easier to say that narrative has become more complex beause we want it to it is probably more accurate to say that narrative is more complex because long-form content is a better platform for loyalty and therefore advertising. Star Wars is a case in point here - the 'first' movie was expliticty written from the three-act form using Joesph Campbells 'call to action' archetypes. The Star Wars Narrative Universe has long-since moved into a multi-strand narrative that is probably too complex for anyone to actually comprehend in one lifetime without being a very deep fan. 

While the creation of fans/consumers is the explicit call of the current practice of online content marketing it has, of course, always been the case. Long-running soaps (and indeed sporting events like the Tour De France) are all about what I call suspended narrative arcs (dramatic action is held back for very long periods of time) and have mined this area of story and commerce for decades. Perhaps it is more accurate to say that the internet has given us a platform able to move these long-form narratives from exploiting one class sytem to another; as the middle class expands and takes their 'devices' with them the internet and on-demand becomes the default culutal consumption device. 

It would also be fair to say that we have moved on from the excitement of fragmented stories and open story systems that characterised early hyperfiction - these remain more interesting in their conception than their executions. 

Despite the once apparently liberating principle of the hyperlink people like  stories that are told to them, both narrative and investigative, and are even more willing to invest long periods of time in good ones. However people are also more open to what makes a good story. 

What has shifted is that people 'do' stories in two ways - assembled by others (Stranger Things) but we are also prepared to assemble our own chains of meaning and interest by following loosely related ('recommended') content in what might be called hyper personal stories. This secondary form of self-directed story making is more akin to analysis in the classic mode - writing outselves with stories we make from fragments. Once this was undertaken with dreams, now the deep pool of alternative content that is the internet is a great substitute. This is writing as self-definition under the sign of the mystery - we like to solve ourselves, looking in the past, sifting truth and memory to create a story that fits our belief in ourselves that we then project to the world. We could call this activity #memeself, or simply as Facebook.

That this #memeself is increasingly self reinforcing is also appratent. the personalisation and graph are used by the majors to reinforce existing personal views and prejudices. Seeing more content that affirms our world view is, at the least, contrary to democracy and at worst we have seen social-bubble effects hijacked by political parties to 'galvanise' mass movements. 

Aftermath will play in this space - using personalisation and graph technologies to alter stories for readers. Sometimes this might be to create a story that is congruent to a readers world view, sometimes we could challenge it. The idea is not to present fragments - this is not about the liberation of the hyperlink - it is to present alternative wholes. 

In this way I am envisaging readers being served personalised books the content being tailored by levels of implicit and explicit choice. A simple example is influencing a story based on whether someone is viewing from above or below the equator - this seemingly simple cut will create different resonances in the story (see below for why).

So I will look at various mechanisms for creating these books from simple personalisation based on IP address through to looking into using people's facebook or adnetwork profiles. See the technical roadmap for more on how I see the progression through these technical points working.

Alongside this I will be aiming to use the power of graph to create interesting, complex and involving stories. 




## What is Aftermath about?

So much for the ideas; what will thi be about and how will the form and content relate?

A straight narrative treated this way is never going to be satisfying to read. Like early branching games choice and 'complete' narratives are a difficult combination to make work - witness the weakness of multi-ended single strand narratives; they end up looking undecided and the authorial effort required to make more than a couple of choices work is immense; all for a thin illusion of reader agency. The satisfying narrative that works with satisfying agency is an ongoing issue that the games industry (with its massive budgets) is best left to tackle. 

A work of lieterature based on the ideas above will be a positive if the following is true: it is complex, non-linear, multi-strand and open ended. The formats that tend to deliver these qualities are memoir, proems, essay, photos or illustrations or comics, mysteries, soaps, impressions. Alternatively the more complex delibertaely wilful forms of 'anti-closure' literature and text-art resonante here too - your Tristram Shandys, modernist verse etc. 

In short the minor, less highbrow modes of serious writing or very highbrow art literature. The middle ground, where the expectation is of completion and closure 'a good story well told', is less profitable for dynamic or algorthic literature. 

Having said all that I am not wedded to obscurity and complexity for it's own sake. Where things have a complex form they must have complex content. 

In order to give myself a large range in which to write over a number of years I aim to develop several layers of work that can vibrate together in an open but satisfying way. These forms mostly will be 'minor'; life-writing, histories, journalistic investigation, comment, memoir. 

My initial proposal is to take an unfinished novel based on my own stageplay which is itself a 'based on true events' fiction about an episode in NZ history known as 'The Furlough Incident.' The play, called Fond Love and Kisses was produced professionally in NZ in 2003. 

A totality, falling apart. The topic if fragmentation and story telling in an effort to rebuild.

The Furlough incident is about the refusal of a thousand soliders to return to WWII after they were granted a furlough in 1943. Their refusal sparked debates around responsibility, the colonial's role in empire, and notions of personal sacrifice and manhood. These men, having fought from Crete to El Alamein, were veterans and bought home angst, experience and conditions that hadn't been seen in NZ society. Of course they were expected to 'get on' with life and not make a fuss.

The play and subsequent fiction is bulit around the experience of two brothers who come back and the fiancee that has been waiting for one of them to return. The overarching narrative of the play was linear but style of the play was moderatley experimental in that I did things like have scenes from several time periods running togther similtaneously - layered time. Issues that I explored in the lay included PTSD, wartime psychiatry (NZ experiemented in 'truth drugs' to unlock PTSD survivors repressed memories), clashes with the unionised dock workers and the huge number of American soldiers being trained for the Pacific war changing popular culture beyond recognition. Essentially post-colonial studies mixed with some surprising history.   

Layered into this relatively straightforward narrative piece I will interleave personal history and memoir. This will have two major strands; the first about being a 'failing' writer and the second about the impact of war on family over three generations. This is where the complexity comes in. Having a 'multinodal' subject structure (WWII, me, family, NZ, mental health, masculinity) will allow the work to have multiple meanings and configurations without seeming depleted or forced. The implication here is that the virtual narrative world will be significantly larger than many of the possible works that come from it. I would expect to have between 200-300,000 words in the final work. 

The style will build on something I have been writing for the last couple of years; a meta-blog called Bike by bike, a collection of autobiogrpahy and essays that is predicated on the device of having one piece per bicycle I have owned. The material in this ranges from simple life-writing to commentary about forests, industrialisation, characteristics of cities, being an immigrant and so on. Having been predominatly a playwright for most of my life the move into prose and essay has been challenging but very rewarding - it's a style of writing that is approachable and authentic. A good, if slightly harrowing piece, [is this one](http://bikeby.bike/bikes/13-everything-must-fall-apart/).

Aftermath will necesarrly be more atomised than Bike by bike and have a much less personal point of view, but using a complex brew of historical events, autobiogpraphy and memoir I will create a broad range of inputs from the purely descriptive to the purely fictional to inhabit the virtual narrative space of this world.

## Writing plan

While I have some existing work on the 


## Technical road map

In order to achieve the piece as whole I will need to work through a number of technical issues:

Understand the graphing database and how to use it to store and retrieve information
Integrate graph engine with a content management system (drupal)
Desing and code content engine
Design and code a front-end for the work, something that will allow users to choose 
Intergrate analytics for reporting but also for 
Layer in marketing technologies (multivariate testing)
Understand adnetwork and facebook APIs; work out how to use them creatively then integrate into the CMS

## Form roadmap

As the technical develops I will be continually writing and my intention is for that writing to be public. Consequently how I will publish the content will change over time:

 - First as a blog; a simple linear presentation of work as it is created
 - Secondly in a CMS tied to a graph engine to start experimenting with form of presentation
 - Add analytics both as a writing mechanism and a tool to allow improving the work
 - Then layer in personalisation engines

The only CMS that will let me do all that without spending a fortune is the open source product Drupal. I have previously used Drupal extensively and have worked professionally in Drupal agencies as a consultant, so I know that it can do what I want. However at a technical level I would look to establish relationships with a couple of developers or via agency sponsorship in order to utlimately achieve the technical capability I need.




Aftermath will use techniques from 



So where do notions like the experience economy

What I am prosing is to bring together data-driven and graph technologies

There is no 'master work'. This goes beyond branching and tagging, and extends into the use of objects and relations. The philosophical background relates to OOO and the Neo-realists while the creative impetous comes from works like HHH which mixes the true story of the 

Such literay excursions are nothing new, the notion of fact and fiction and stories within stories is as old as the '1001 nights'. Fiction that configures around alternative non-narrative forms like '247' or explicitly 

Fiction that explicitly uses autobiography as an articulating device is rarer. Perhaps this is only because 'life writing' has a bad name, or perhaps it is that life-writing is already so obviously fiction that no one notices.
