## Proposal in a para

Use 

Use marketing and personalisation technologies (deep data, graph, segmentation) to create and present a customised creative nonfiction work about a compelling piece of social history.

### What

1. Adtech and Graph

The assumption is that the most advanced content placement techniques ('content marketing') are used in advertising networks by the likes of Google, Outbrain and Facebook. These companies lever multiple sources of personal information to target ads to end users using multiple and deep data sources such as Experian and their own big data stores. This targeting is both used to serve ads (Google Ad Network) and present users with content that is more likely to result in them clicking ads (facebook, Outbrain). Effectively there is no distinction between ads and content; they are treated the same, compationally speaking.

The amount of effort and intelligence used to create the mechanisms of deep data that power these are immense, it is not an exageration to say that the technical pinnacle of online programming is the serving of ads.

Deep data is driven by Graph technologies. These store entites in loose and complex structures which can be added to and reconfigured on the fly. Unlike static data where the central descriptor is a 'keyed' node (a static property of a node) and where complexity rapidly introduces labyrynthine complexity, graph data is structured by relations. Graph data sits behind the friend of a friend and other complex content recommendation algorhythms that drive a platform like Netflix. Again it is no exageration to say that the social web simply isn't possible without a Graph approach. 

Graph data is expressed in decriptive and active language; (Mary) - [friend] -> (Ben). Mary is a friend to Ben. This allows for poetic assemblages of data; you could say; Mary - [shades] -> Ben. Or; The Moon - [lives] in - The Ocean. To return information we aren't using SQL (essentially set theory) to find 'matches' across a whole database, instead we traverse a data structure, beginning at an arbitary point. To use a more philosophical comparator SQL data is all about categories and definitions of what is (rational, static structures of knowledge) where Graph is more about dynamic relations of what could be; more akin to The Rhizomatic.

2. New narratives - the rise of the long-form, complex and hybrid narrative structures.

Paralell to this we have seen a surge in the use of complex narratives in long-form work that spans fiction and non-fiction. The three-act structure is a useful tool in the arsenal for these succesful works but it's only one tool of many. Mystery and tone are just as likely to create a great work as driving narrative (24, Homeland). Madmen is the classic case in point here - the dramatic questions of the first couple of series around Donald's past are simply abandoned and no one seemed to mind as long as the tone was right and interetsing people came in. Madmen breaks many rules; We never get a conclusion about Donalds moral worth for instance, and somewhere along the way Peggy becomes more interesting. Madmen also has episodes that about nothing in particular in terms of dramatic action - tonal episodes that don't advance the story but shine a light on a character. This is narrative as fractal or facet rather than completed or conclusive.

We have also become used to non-fiction where the writer explicity sits inside the work and uses the act of writing to further articulate the work of non-fiction. Here we get the work of authors like XXX who, in HHH, writes about an assisinatin attepmt on Heinreich Himmler from a distinctly personal point of view. This makes a series of historic events significantly more interesting, and we get things like podcats where the investigator is unsure of the outcome of the narrative as they are producing it.

While it is tempting to think that culture has 'grown up' in the sense that TV is now commonly emplying ideas and techniques that were previously avant-garde, it is probably more accurate to say that narrative is more complex because digital long-form content is a better platform for loyalty and therefore advertising. Star Wars is a case in point here - the first (or fourth) movie on 1977 was expliticty written from the three-act form using Joesph Campbells 'call to action' archetypes. The Star Wars Narrative Universe has long-since moved into a multi-strand narrative that is probably too complex for anyone to actually comprehend in one lifetime without developing mental health issues. The recent Rebel One movie took a single moment from the 1977 movie and asked 'how did that get to be there?'.

While the creation of fans/consumers is the explicit call of the current practice of online content marketing it has, the creation of the fan has always been important. Printed serials, long-running soaps and even sporting events like the Tour De France, are all about suspended narrative arcs where dramatic action is held back for very long periods of time. Content creators have mined this area of story and commerce for centuries. Perhaps it is more accurate to say that the internet has given us a platform able to move these long-form narratives from exploiting one class system to another; as the middle class expands and takes their 'devices' with them the internet and on-demand becomes the default cultural consumption device. 

3. Death of hyperfiction?

It would also be fair to say that we have moved on from the excitement of fragmented stories and open story systems that characterised early hyperfiction - these remain more interesting in their conception than their executions. Early hyperfiction authors have tended to drift one of three ways - they move to gaming, move towards conceptual art or back to print. Hyperfiction for it's own sake is mostly an obscure hobby now.

Despite the once apparently liberating principle of the hyperlink people like stories that are told to them, both narrative and investigative, and are even more willing to invest long periods of time in good ones. The difference between the 'when will this end?' of reading hyperfiction and the 'I don't want this to end' of complex 'told' narrative is significant and, I think, terminal in the case of hyperfiction.

What has shifted is that people 'do' stories in two ways - assembled by others (Stranger Things) but we are also prepared to assemble our own chains of meaning and interest by following loosely related ('recommended') content in what might be called hyperpersonal stories. This secondary form of self-directed story making is more akin to analysis in the classic mode - writing outselves with stories we make from fragments. Once this was undertaken with dreams, now the deep pool of alternative content that is the internet is a great substitute. This is writing as self-definition under the sign of the mystery - we like to solve ourselves, looking in the past, sifting truth and memory to create a story that fits our belief in ourselves that we then project to the world. We could call this activity #memeself, or more simply as Facebook.

That this #memeself is increasingly self reinforcing is also appratent. Personalisation and graph are used by the majors to reinforce existing personal views and prejudices. Seeing more content that affirms our world view is, at the least, contrary to democracy and at worst we have seen social-bubble effects hijacked by political parties to 'galvanise' mass movements. 

Aftermath will play in this space - using personalisation and graph technologies to alter stories for readers. Sometimes this might be to create a story that is congruent to a readers world view, sometimes we could challenge it. The idea is not to present fragments - this is not about the liberation of the hyperlink - it is to present alternative wholes. 

In this way I am envisaging readers being served personalised books the content being tailored by levels of implicit and explicit choice. A simple example is influencing a story based on whether someone is viewing from above or below the equator - this seemingly simple cut will create different resonances in the story (see below for why).

So I will look at various mechanisms for creating these books from simple personalisation based on IP address through to looking into using people's facebook or adnetwork profiles. See the technical roadmap for more on how I see the progression through these technical points working.

Alongside this I will be aiming to use the power of graph to create interesting, complex and involving stories, but in the spitit of a grand hack.




4. Social history... life writing... creative nonfiction... what is Aftermath actually about?

So much for the ideas; what will the peice be about and how will the form and content relate to each other?

A linear narrative treated this way is never going to be satisfying to read. Like early branching games choice and 'complete' narratives are a difficult combination to make work - witness the weakness of multi-ended single strand narratives; they end up looking undecided and the authorial effort required to make more than a couple of choices work is immense; all for a thin illusion of reader agency. The satisfying narrative that works with and for satisfying agency is a difficult and ongoing issue that the games industry (with its massive budgets) is best left to tackle. 

A work of lieterature based on the ideas above will be a positive if the following is true: it is complex, non-linear, multi-strand and open ended. The formats that tend to deliver these qualities are memoir, p(r)oems, essay, photos or illustrations or comics, mysteries, soaps, impressions. Alternatively the more complex delibertaely wilful forms of 'anti-closure' literature and text-art resonante here too - your Tristram Shandys, modernist verse etc. 

In short the minor, less highbrow modes of serious writing or very highbrow art literature. The middle ground, where the expectation is of completion and closure 'a good story well told', is not profitable for dynamic or algorthic literature. I am not trying to write a Booker winner.

Having said all that I am not wedded to obscurity and complexity for it's own sake. Where things have a complex form they must have complex content. 

In order to give myself a large range in which to write over a number of years I aim to develop several layers of work that can vibrate together in an open but satisfying way. These forms mostly will be 'minor'; life-writing, histories, journalistic investigation, comment, memoir. 

My initial proposal is to take an unfinished novel based on my own stageplay which is itself a 'based on true events' fiction about an episode in NZ history known as 'The Furlough Incident.' The play, called Fond Love and Kisses was produced professionally in NZ in 2003. 

During the Furlough incident a thousand soliders refused to return to WWII after they were granted a furlough in NZ. Their refusal sparked debates around personal scrifice, the colonial role in empire, and notions of service, reward and manhood. These men, having fought from Crete to El Alamein, were veterans and bought home their angst and experiences that were new to NZ society. Of course they were expected to 'get on' with the war once they had taken their break; no shirking allowed. The Furlough men's basic argument was that they have given three years, now it was someone elses turn. With the protected industries of farming, manufacture and transport there were plenty of young men to replace them.

The play is bulit around the experience of two brothers who come back and the fiancee that has been waiting for one of them to return. The overarching narrative of the play was linear but style of the play was moderatley experimental in that I did things like have scenes from several time periods running togther similtaneously - layered time. Issues that I explored in the play included PTSD, wartime psychiatry (NZ experiemented in 'truth drugs' to unlock PTSD survivors repressed memories), clashes with the unionised dock workers and the huge number of American soldiers being trained for the Pacific war changing popular culture beyond recognition. Essentially post-colonial studies mixed with some surprising and supressed history.   

Layered into this relatively straightforward narrative piece I will interleave personal history and memoir. This will have two major strands; the first about being a 'failing' writer and the second about the impact of war on family over three generations. This is where the complexity comes in. Having a 'multinodal' subject structure (WWII, me, family, NZ, mental health, masculinity) will allow the work to have multiple meanings and configurations without seeming depleted or forced. The implication here is that the virtual narrative world will be significantly larger than many of the possible works that come from it. I would expect to have between 200-300,000 words in the final work. 

The style will build on something I have been writing for the last couple of years; a meta-blog called Bike by bike, a collection of autobiogrpahy and essays that is predicated on the device of having one piece per bicycle I have owned. The material in this ranges from simple life-writing to commentary about forests, industrialisation, characteristics of cities, being an immigrant and so on. Having been predominatly a playwright for most of my life the move into prose and essay has been challenging but very rewarding and something I want to extend. A good, if slightly harrowing piece, [is this one](http://bikeby.bike/bikes/13-everything-must-fall-apart/).

Aftermath will necesarrly be more atomised than Bike by bike and have a much less personal point of view, but using a complex brew of historical events, autobiogpraphy and memoir I will create a broad range of inputs from the purely descriptive to the purely fictional to inhabit the virtual narrative space of this world.

## But why?

Aftermath will be a grand hack. Using tools, technologies and concepts that corporations currently use for survailence marketing to both expose and use that information in the production of cultural meaning that cannot be owned and recirculated by those same corporations.

Aftermath is therefore an explicit critique of the singluarising narrative urge and, by extension, cultural monism - the reduction of things to 'a single source of truth' that are then typed and resold. Unlike conventional life writing it is not aiming to reduce to essences or make sense of the past, rather it is aiming to write like life is experienced - a glorious, untamable, riot... or maybe a party.

It is explicitly about detaching true self as multiple from the machinery of priority and privledge. Mark Zuckerberg said that people should only use their real names online and implied that anyone who had more than one name, or used aliases is criminal at worst and inauthentic at best. Of course he would say that he has a lot of money to make from real names. However people use aliases for legtimate reasons, but, crucially aliases make it more difficult for survilance marketing to 'remarket' to you.

Living or writing the aliased, messy, multiple, untyped self has become then, not just a literary trophe or style, but an act of subversion. Of course that style of subversion is priviledged and positioned - I can afford the time and have sufficient agency to do so - but it also is located in the very heart of the territory; it is my time and agency and money that are being mined by the corporations. Is it a stretch to say that it is more revolutionary to create multiple selves and aliases than it is to protest in Trafalgar Square? Is it pointless to strom the embassy becuase the real power is in owning infastructure and data and algorhythms?

## Challenges

There ar nultiple challenges in this work:

The writing itself. This will involve more research on the topic as well as continually pushing on the content and style.

Web development: Using graph databases in content management solutions is a niche and new area and one I don't know a lot about; there are multiple technical challenges here that might require relationships with a couple of developers or agency/company sponsorship in order to utlimately achieve the technical capability I need.

Data and adtech: There are some interesting questions to research in here; Is it possible to alter a facebook profile of yourself by using 'dazzle data'? Can you 'pass' a creative work inside an adnetwork? Will I need to create my own deep data hooks?

Marketting: As this project will be using marketting techniques I will need to understand them better and extend knowledge of analytics, multivariate testing, SEO and other techniques of attraction.

##Sketch plan

### Writing plan

While I have some existing work in the form of the play and around 70k words of a novel there is a lot to do to extend that further. There is also a degree of complex planning to do as I think the best way to proceed is to create one full layer as a Minimal Viable Product and then work to add further layers over time. 


## Technical road map

In order to achieve the piece as whole I will need to work through a number of technical issues:

 - Understand the graphing database and how to use it to store and retrieve information
 - Integrate graph engine with a content management system
 - Design and code the content engine
 - Design and code a front-end for the work, something that will allow users to choose 
 - Intergrate analytics for reporting but also for 
 - Layer in marketing technologies
 - Understand adnetwork and facebook APIs; work out how to use them creatively then integrate into the CMS

## Form roadmap

As the technical develops I will be continually writing and my intention is for that writing to be public. Consequently how I will publish the content will change over time:

 - First as a blog; a simple linear presentation of work as it is created
 - Secondly in a CMS tied to a graph engine to start experimenting with form of presentation
 - Add analytics both as a writing mechanism and a tool to allow improving the work
 - Then layer in personalisation engines




Aftermath will use techniques from 



So where do notions like the experience economy

What I am prosing is to bring together data-driven and graph technologies


Activities

Create a narrative site that tells the story

Insert the story into existing ad networks

The reader can create a one-off work 

There is no 'master work'. This goes beyond branching and tagging, and extends into the use of objects and relations. The philosophical background relates to OOO and the Neo-realists while the creative impetous comes from works like HHH which mixes the true story of the 

Such literay excursions are nothing new, the notion of fact and fiction and stories within stories is as old as the '1001 nights'. Fiction that configures around alternative non-narrative forms like '247' or explicitly 

Fiction that explicitly uses autobiography as an articulating device is rarer. Perhaps this is only because 'life writing' has a bad name, or perhaps it is that life-writing is already so obviously fiction that no one notices.
